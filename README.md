In my project I use [Multi-Tacitron-Voice-Cloning](https://github.com/vlomme/Multi-Tacotron-Voice-Cloning) repository. It is a phonemic multilingual (Russian-English) implementation based on Real-Time-Voice-Cloning. it is a four-stage deep learning framework that allows to create a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio, and to use it to condition a text-to-speech model
